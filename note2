to get the direction of the camera element we can use the .getWorldDirection(vectorVariable) method defined in Three.js.
camera.getWorldDirection(direction), will set the value of the vector given by the method in the direction variable.

preset- This is used to set the environment type and valid values are none, default, contact, egypt, checkerboard, forest, goaland, yavapai, goldmine, threetowers, poison, arches, tron, japan, dream, volcano, starry, osiris. 

skyType- This is used to set the type of sky element and valid values are color, gradient, atmosphere. 

skyColor- This can be used to set the color of the sky element when the skyType is set color or gradient. 

lighting- This is used to set up the lighting in the environment and the valid values are none, distant, point.

Vectors are mathematical objects which have magnitude and direction.

The direction tells in which direction the vector will be starting from the origin that is (0 0 0).

The magnitude value tells how long the length will be starting from one point to another.

The length of 1 unit is the standard length of the vectors which is known as the unit vector.
